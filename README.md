### Definition of Artificial intelligence AI
the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.
Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning and neural networks 
represent incredibly exciting and powerful machine learning-based techniques used to solve many real-world problems.
 For a primer on machine learning, you may want to read this five-part series that I wrote.
While human-like deductive reasoning, inference, and decision-making by a computer is still a long time away, 
there have been remarkable gains in the application of AI techniques and associated algorithms.

### What Is Intelligence?
All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.
